# bikesharing

## Purpose
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Deliverables
Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Deliverable 2 - Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
I created high level stat visualizations to drive home the need for analytical minds to see the actual data.
